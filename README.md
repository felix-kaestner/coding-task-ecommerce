# React + Next.js Online Shop

This repository contains a minimal _simple_ online shop written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), written as part of a coding task during a job application.

For styling [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) and [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) are used.

A SQLite3 Database is used for persistence.

## Quickstart

Install all dependencies via `yarn`/`npm`/`pnpm`:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

Build the application for production:

```sh
$ yarn build
```

Start the server:

```sh
$ yarn start
```

Afterwards, open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
